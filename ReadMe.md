# Greetings Developers

    Let me borrow a bit of your time and hold your hand as I discuss the simple Data Structure of your application as you open the app it will display the loading screen (I used flutter package to create a simple animation) it needs internet connectivity to get its data from the third-party API and will display the current time which I set to 'Asia/Manila', the user can select a location to display time on its home screen but will be gone when the app terminated.

## KEY TAKEAWAY NOTE

    This app **depends on a third-party API** to fetch the current time to be displayed on the home screen you will need  internet connectivity as you go along while the **CAVEAT** of that, I observed that **due to the massive amount of request to the website API sometimes the app return a red screen error**, but it will resolve it by re-running the application, sometimes it takes time but please be patient.

    *The Source Code is stored in the lib folder, services
    * Images stored in the assets directory
    * Fonts stored in the fonts directory

## Key Takeaways

1. This app was created using the **Flutter Framework** and uses **Dart** as the programming language, **Flutter/Dart is not recommended if you don't have an understanding of the core building blocks of programming**.
2. IDE - you can use **VSCode** and **Android Studio** to start building the **Flutter app**.
3. Google Fonts - **Montserrat-Medium**
4. Images I get on google, lol.
[Uses Spinkit as you see while loading the app] <https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_spinkit>
